This is a small mobile plateform based on an ATmega 1284p running bitlash.

A TFT screen is used as a display. Library is here https://github.com/fdufnews/OPENSMART_TFT
Schematic of the board is in the [Doc directory](../Doc/1284_portable_V2.pdf)

An Xbox Chatpad is used as an input device. The chatpad is reprogrammed with the OpenKeyboard Project firmware in order to send keys on the serial line. No link to this project as they are all dead links.
