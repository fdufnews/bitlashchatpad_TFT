This is a small mobile platform based on an ATmega 1284p running bitlash.

A TFT screen is used as a display. Library is here https://github.com/fdufnews/OPENSMART_TFT

An Xbox Chatpad is used as an input device. The chatpad is reprogrammed with the OpenKeyboard Project firmware in order to send keys on the serial line. No link to this project as they are all dead links.
